The CICERONE flag marks observations that fall within the minimum or expanded NACE ranges defined in the CICERONE project, while the other (the OpenMusE SBS flag) marks observations belonging to the core or extended music-sector definitions developed in OpenMusE.

It was reconstructed in the OpenMusic Wikibase https://reprexbase.eu/openmusic/) to demonstrate alignment between European statistical metadata (SDMX) and linked-data publication formats used in the cultural-heritage domain.\nThe dataset uses RDF/Turtle format and aligns Wikibase schema elements (wikibase:Item, wikibase:Property) with W3C and SDMX standards. Dataset-level metadata (schema:Dataset) record provenance (prov:wasDerivedFrom, dct:source) and licensing (CC0 1.0).\nThese alignments allow full interoperability between Eurostat’s SDMX-based dissemination and linked-data environments such as the EU Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe dimensions of the dataset:\n\nNACE economic activity (dimension)\ntime (dataset dimension) currently not added, but it would be absolutely essential\ngeopolitical entity (dimension) not present now but would be absolutely necessary\n\nThe measured variables of the datacube:\n\nnumber of enterprises\nnet turnover of enterprises in million euros,\n\nThe attributes of the dataset: These are currently not recorded, but it would be a very good practice, and they are present in the data that you retrieve from Eurostat,\n\nunit of measure (attribute) (not present now)\nfrequency (attribute) (not present now)\nOpenMusE SBS music-sector flag\nCICERONE music classification flag\n\nThe dataset is openly available for reuse and serves as a model for FAIR statistical data integration in the cultural and creative domains.\nPurpose and context\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomics summary\n\n\n\nYou should describe here in one paragraph what this indicator can be used for and what not.

Most of our data in the form of datasets, and other data (i.e. visualizations, texts, complex documents and live policy documents) will be openly accessible unless otherwise stated in this DMP.\n\n2.2.1 Repostories\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill the data be deposited in a trusted repository?\nHave you explored appropriate arrangements with the identified repository where your data will be deposited?\nDoes the repository ensure that the data is assigned an identifier? Will the repository resolve the identifier to a digital object?\n\n\n\n\nOur main, long-term repository for data is Zenodo. The project’s 5.1 deliverable, the Open Music Observatory, had a minimum viable product prototype, the Digital Music Observatory, which has had a community on Zenodo since 2021. (Digital Music Observatory 2021b)\nOur short-term repository, following the Open Policy Analysis Guidelines, provides access and reviewability to our data and inputs from the very early stage (in some cases, regarding documentation, from the proposal phase.) These repositories are stored on GitHub, and their addresses are available in the reference list of this DMP and via our project website.\nZenodo and GitHub offer continuous integration with each other. GitHub will be used as a working repository to comply with the OPA Level 3 standard, and data assets that are approved for dissemination and communication will be placed onto Zenodo.\nFigShare is a repository aimed at reusable visualisations. While we can also place visualisations on GitHub and Zenodo, FigShare has a visualization-centric global audience. When visualisations can be reused individually, we will place them FigShare, and use FigShare’s DOIs as persistent identifiers. Naturally, when the primary DOI and dissemination point of a dataset and its methodological description is Zenodo and the visualisations’ is FigShare, we will cross-reference these assets. The project’s 5.1 deliverable, the Open Music Observatory, had a minimum viable product prototype, the Digital Music Observatory, which has had a community on Zenodo since 2021. (Digital Music Observatory 2021a)\n\n\n2.2.3 Metadata\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetadata\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill metadata be made openly available and licenced under a public domain dedication CC0, as per the Grant Agreement? If not, please clarify why. Will metadata contain information to enable the user to access the data?\nHow long will the data remain available and findable? Will metadata be guaranteed to remain available after data is no longer available?\nWill documentation or reference about any software be needed to access or read the data be included? Will it be possible to include the relevant software (e.g. in open source code)?\n\n\n\n\nThe metadata of Open Music Europe data will be openly available and in human-readable, reusable, and machine-readable format(s).\nIn the first phase of the project (M1-M16), this will be achieved by periodically releasing all data on the Zenodo open science repository in the Digital Music Observatory collection. All data deposited and released in the repository will have metadata available in the following metadata formats: MARCXML, Dublin Core (according to OpenAIRE Guidelines), DataCite, DCAT, and JSON-LD (Schema.org).\nIn the second phase of the project, we will start delivering the D5.1 Open Data Observatory, which will provide API access to our data (via SQL queries and in machine-readable JSON format) and provide further machine-readable data catalogues along the aforementioned solution.\nThe metadata (and the data) will be deposited on Zenodo, which provides access to the data for the lifetime of the host laboratory CERN, which currently has an experimental programme defined for the next 20 years at least.\nAccording to the Exploitation Plan of the Open Music Europe Consortium, our plan is to make our Open Music Observatory, as part of a larger Digital Music Observatory, eventually part of the planned European Music Observatory. If this is not feasible, we would like to find an exploitation path that ensures the continuity of the data collection, processing, and dissemination of the project. If successful, then we will not only provide long-term access to the data and the metadata but continue to renew our datasets.\nAlmost all data will be provided in a way that it can be used and reused in numerous widely used open sources and licensed software applications. To enhance interoperability, we will always provide data CSV files that conform to the W3C interoperability standard about the release of CSV files with metadata.\nAfter consulting stakeholders in the target group of our project, we may provide data in different file formats that is more comfortable for our users.\nOne of our projects aims is to provide a fully reproducible data-to-policy pipeline and full reproducibility in the R statistical environment and language. The R environment is both open-source and interoperable; it is available on a wide range of operational systems (i.e., various Linux or BSD distributions, including MacOS and various Windows operating systems.) Apart from using the resilient but inefficient CSV format, we will release data in native rdf formats. One of our aims in our Work Package 4 is to create an extension package to the R language (library ecosystem) that ensures an easy reproduction of our data-to-policy pipeline."

(Source: https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/i3-metadata-include-qualified-references-metadata/)\n\n\n\n\nAs data interoperability intersects with data reuse, we explain some of our approach in 2.4.\n\n2.3.1 Commonly used ontologies, vocabularies, and data models\nOur datasets follow the vocabularies and definitions of the data model of the Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange (SDMX), i.e., the SDMX 3.0 Technical Specifications. Section 2 Information Model: UML Conceptual Design. Version 3.0 which provides the widest possible interoperability with the data products of national statistical agencies and international agencies such as Eurostat or OECD (SDMX 2021). We will also comply with the W3C’s RDF Data Cube Vocabulary, which applies the datacube and dataset model of SDMX to the word wide web (W3C 2014).\nThe combination of SDMX and RDF Data Cube standards ensures that OpenMusic data can be automatically harvested, linked, and reused by Eurostat-compliant systems, the EU Open Data Portal, OpenAIRE and other linked open data repositories, and cultural heritage knowledge graphs such as Wikidata, Europena and the European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH).\n\nProperty alignment between OpenMusic Wikibase and SDMX / RDF Data Cube\n\n\n\nOpenMusic property\nFunction / role\nSDMX equivalent\nRDF Data Cube equivalent\nExample entity / comment\n\n\n\n\nom:P140 (“dimension (dataset)”)\nIdentifies one axis of observation (e.g., time, sex, education)\nsdmx:DimensionProperty\nqb:DimensionProperty\nwd:Q456 “sex (dimension)”, wd:Q472 “time (dimension)”\n\n\nom:P141 (“measure (dataset)”)\nQuantitative variable observed\nsdmx:MeasureProperty\nqb:MeasureProperty\nwd:Q471 “persons practising artistic activities (measure)”\n\n\nom:P142 (“attribute (dataset)”)\nQualifying metadata (unit, frequency, status)\nsdmx:AttributeProperty\nqb:AttributeProperty\nwd:Q469 “unit of measure”, wd:Q470 “frequency”\n\n\nom:P146 (“has code list”)\nLinks a dimension or concept to its controlled vocabulary\nsdmx:codeList\n—\nwd:Q463 “CL_SEX”\n\n\nom:P145 (“publisher”)\nIdentifies data provider\nsdmx:DataProvider\ndct:publisher\nwd:Q449 “Eurostat”\n\n\nom:P95 (“DOI”)\nPersistent identifier\nsdmx:Identifier\ndct:identifier\n10.2908/ILC_SCP07\n\n\nom:P130 (“has access point”)\nAccess URL for dataset\n—\ndcat:accessURL / schema:url\nhttps://doi.org/10.2908/ILC_SCP07\n\n\nprov:wasDerivedFrom\nProvenance record\nsdmx:source\nprov:wasDerivedFrom\nOriginal Eurostat dataset source\n\n\ncc:license\nRights and licensing\nsdmx:DataSetAnnotation (conceptual)\ndct:license\nCC0 1.0 Public Domain Dedication\n\n\n\n\n\nClass alignment between OpenMusic Wikibase, SDMX, and W3C RDF Data Cube\n\n\n\nOpenMusic / Wikibase class\nom:Q285 (“data set”)\nEquivalent SDMX concept\nsdmx:DataStructureDefinition\nEquivalent W3C Data Cube / W3C class\nqb:DataStructureDefinition\nDescription\nDefines the structure of dimensions, measures, and attributes within the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nom:Q446 (“Persons practising artistic activities by sex, age, education and frequency”)\nsdmx:DataSet\nqb:DataSet\nRepresents the Eurostat dataset reconstructed as RDF.\n\n\n\nom:Q449 (“Eurostat”)\nsdmx:DataProvider\ndct:publisher\nOrganisation responsible for providing and maintaining the dataset.\n\n\n\nom:Q456 (“sex (dimension)”)\nsdmxdim:SEX\nqb:DimensionProperty\nDimension variable defining the sex of the observed population.\n\n\n\nom:Q467 (“geopolitical entity (dimension)”)\nsdmxdim:REF_AREA\nqb:DimensionProperty\nDimension variable defining the geographic area (country or region).\n\n\n\nom:Q472 (“time (dataset dimension)”)\nsdmxdim:TIME_PERIOD\nqb:DimensionProperty\nDimension variable defining the reference time period.\n\n\n\nom:Q466 (“educational attainment (dimension)”)\nsdmxdim:EDUCLEVEL\nqb:DimensionProperty\nDimension representing the highest level of education attained.\n\n\n\nom:Q471 (“persons practising artistic activities (measure)”)\nsdmx:Measure\nqb:MeasureProperty\nQuantitative variable representing the observed value (number or percentage of persons).\n\n\n\nom:Q469 (“unit of measure (attribute)”)\nsdmx:UNIT_MEASURE\nqb:AttributeProperty\nAttribute specifying the unit of measurement (e.g., percentage of persons).\n\n\n\nom:Q470 (“frequency (attribute)”)\nsdmxdim:FREQ\nqb:AttributeProperty\nAttribute describing the observation’s reporting frequency (annual, quarterly, etc.).\n\n\n\nom:Q463 (“CL_SEX”)\nsdmx:CodeList\nskos:ConceptScheme\nControlled vocabulary providing coded values for the “sex” dimension.\n\n\n\nom:Q604 net turnover (million euro)\nESTAT:INDIC_SBS(10.0)\n\n\nEurostat SBS 4.1 indicator\n\n\nom:Q605 enterprise number\nESTAT:INDIC_SBS(10.0)\n\n\nEurostat SBS 4.1 indicator\n\n\nom:Q602 OpenMusE SBS music-sector flag |\nOpenMusE defined\n\n\nD1.2 reference\n\n\nom:Q601 CICERONE music classification flag\nOpenMusE defined\n\n\nD1.2 reference\n\n\n\nIn WP1 we will use, beyond the SDMX taxonomies and ontologies the new ESCO 2.0 ontology (De Smedt et al. 2024).\nThese definitions were designed for statistical datasets, and they are directly applicable to our indicator datasets. However, with simplifications, they can also apply to our microdata, except that these datasets contain statistically not yet processed raw data. This means that the microdata datasets will contain the measures and dimensions as grouping variables, which will become the measures and dimensions of the indicator dataset after statistical aggregation.\nIn T3.2, we will aim to apply more and more of the DDI Standards, starting with the DDI-Codebook 2.5 standard (DDI Alliance 2012). Later versions of this DMP will guide on the introduction of further DDI standards.\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Qualified references\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThis part is basically a rewording of the requirements with the exception of handling the issue of ISWC that needs to be clarified with CISAC.\n\n\n\nIf the data set builds on another data set, if additional data sets are needed to complete the data, or if complementary information is stored in a different data set, this needs to be specified. This will be the case in many of our datasets.\nFrom a data documentation point of view, a scientific link between the data sets needs will be described, and all data sets will be cited with the inclusion of their persistent identifiers.\nThis approach will be taken with our indicator datasets, which follow as closely as possible SDMX practices; complex indicators will often use as components of pre-existing datasets disseminated following the SDMX standards.\n\n\n2.3.3 Data exchange and reuse across disciplines\nWe mainly foster interdisciplinary reuse of our indicator datasets by applying the cross-domain codebooks for data attributes and dimensions of SDMX, which are precisely designed for cross-domain interoperability.\n\n\n2.3.4 Data exchange in the music sector\nNot applicable here."

    "text": "2.4 Increase data reuse\nThe Open Music Europe project aims to establish a reproducible and interoperable model for reusable data in the European music and cultural sector. Because data generation is a core objective of the project—not a secondary activity—our data management strategy combines open science principles with careful handling of intellectual property, privacy, and cultural rights. We apply a tiered openness model, ensuring that each dataset and its accompanying metadata are reusable to the maximum extent permitted by law, ethics, and partner agreements.\nOur practices improve both machine-actionable and human reuse.\n\nAll data and documentation follow the FAIR principles and the Open Policy Analysis (OPA) Guidelines Level 3, ensuring full reproducibility and transparent provenance.\n\n2.4.1 Documentation standards\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nHow will you provide documentation needed to validate data analysis and facilitate data reuse (e.g. readme files with information on methodology, codebooks, data cleaning, analyses, variable definitions, units of measurement, etc.)?\nWill the provenance of the data be thoroughly documented using the appropriate standards?\n\n\n\nAll datasets are produced in compliance with the OPA Guidelines (Level 3), which require transparent documentation and open computational workflows.\nEach dataset is accompanied by a README and structured according to the Standard File Structure (SFS) used throughout the Consortium. These folders, together with Quarto or R Markdown notebooks, ensure that each data transformation is reproducible.\nProvenance is recorded according to the relevant domain standards:\n\nStatistical data use SDMX and W3C RDF Data Cube provenance elements (prov:wasDerivedFrom, dct:source);\nSurvey data follow the DDI standard for variable- and respondent-level documentation;\n\nIn the second phase of the project, the deliverable D5.1 Open Music Observatory will provide a consolidated, machine-actionable data catalogue (DCAT 2.0), and this DMP will be updated accordingly.\n\n\n2.4.2 Good data semantics\nData are structured so that their format reflects their analytical meaning, making them easy to reuse both by humans and by software systems.\nAll tabular data follow the tidy data principle, a statistical restatement of Codd’s third normal form.\nThe structure conforms to SDMX and RDF Data Cube definitions: columns represent measures, dimensions, and attributes, while each row represents one observation (qb:Observation).\nColumn names follow a standardised snake_case convention for readability and interoperability.\nObservations and entities are uniquely identified with persistent identifiers (PIDs), typically HTTP URIs resolving to the OpenMusic Wikibase (https://reprexbase.eu/openmusic/).\nThis ensures semantic and programmatic alignment across linked datasets.\nFor visualisations, semantic integrity means using accurate, non-misleading forms of representation.\nFor textual and complex documents, it means maintaining a clear structure with summaries, references, and provenance metadata.\n\n\n2.4.3 API access\nWe provide various level of API access to the datasets.\n\n\n2.4.4 Data licensing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nWill your data be made freely available in the public domain to permit the widest re-use possible?\n\nWill your data be licensed using standard reuse licences, in line with the obligations set out in the Grant Agreement?\n\nWill the data produced in the project be usable by third parties, in particular after the end of the project?\n\n\n\n\nLicensing follows a tiered model that distinguishes between metadata, open data, and restricted data:\n\nMetadata — All metadata describing datasets, variables, and provenance are released under CC0 1.0 Public Domain Dedication.\nThis allows unrestricted reuse, harvesting, and aggregation in catalogues such as Zenodo, OpenAIRE, and the ECCCH data space.\nOpen data — Aggregated or derived datasets produced by the project (e.g. statistical indicators, anonymised survey summaries, or cultural statistics) are released under CC BY 4.0, unless specific partner or source conditions require another licence.\nEach dataset’s licence is declared explicitly in its metadata (dct:license) under the om:P148 property.\n\nAs a general principle, the project applies an “open by default, protected by exception” policy. This ensures compliance with the Horizon Europe open-science obligations while respecting legal and ethical constraints.\n\n\n2.4.5 Other data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFurther to the FAIR principles, DMPs should also address research outputs other than data, and should carefully consider aspects related to the allocation of resources, data security and ethical aspects.\n\n\nIn addition to datasets, the project produces software code, methodological notebooks, documentation, and live policy reports.\nThese are versioned and released under appropriate open-source or Creative Commons licences (typically MIT, GPL-3.0, or CC BY 4.0).\nEach output is linked to its underlying dataset and provenance record in the Open Music Observatory catalogue."

Most of our analysis, hypothesises, software code used for data processing, and the data itself is open.
